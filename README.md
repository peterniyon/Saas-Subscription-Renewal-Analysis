# Saas-Subscription-Renewal-Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer behavior and identify key factors influencing subscription renewals for a SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) company. The company has provided three datasets—client details, subscription records, and economic indicators—which will be merged and analyzed to answer specific business questions.
